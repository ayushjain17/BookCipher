# BookCipher
Android App to text in coded language

Using this android app you can chat with your friends and other people with this app in code words.

You just need to enter the text you want to send and the app will generate a code for your message using the "book cipher" method of encoding messages with the provided reference text (mentioned in the app).

Copy the encoded text using the copy feature and send it your friends. Voila!! Now no one seeing the message can understand your secret message.

Your friends just need to recopy the text and use the decode feature of the app to get the original message.
